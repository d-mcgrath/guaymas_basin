# Deep Ocean Drilling Reveals Bacterial and Archaeal Metagenome-assembled Genomes Shaped by Thermal and Geochemical Gradients in Deep Sediments at Contrasting Sites in Guaymas Basin

This repository contains scripts, data, and computing environments used for the analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets from the Guaymas Basin, Mexico for the study "Deep Ocean Drilling Reveals Bacterial and Archaeal Metagenome-assembled Genomes Shaped by Thermal and Geochemical Gradients in Deep Sediments at Contrasting Sites in Guaymas Basin". The authors of this manuscript are D. Geller-McGrath, P. Mara, V. Edgcomb, D. Beaudoin and A. Teske. The scripts, files, and data here were written and uploaded by D. Geller-McGrath.

To view the code used for this analysis, click here: https://d-mcgrath.github.io/guaymas_basin/. This is a GitHub pages document that contains R scripts for figure creation and data analysis, as well as bash scripts for data analysis that was done using a high performance computing cluster (HPC). The R script chunks contain in order the code for creation of figures 1-5 in the main text, and supplementary figure 1. Bash scripts for analysis done on an HPC are below the R scripts.
